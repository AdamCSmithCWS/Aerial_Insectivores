Yellow-bellied Flycatcher,BBS,NA,NA,BBS,BBS,BBS,"BBS (MI) low reliability due to coverage. Coverage is borderline between low and medium; precision is high, CI don't overlap 0, and probability of change being LI is 95%, and OBBA, which covers portion of northern range, shows LI also (coverage of canadian population by OBBA considered borderline med/low).  Therefore would normally consider increasing reliability to medium.  NA BBS not useful because majority of range is in Canada.  However, looking more closely at BCR and strata level trends, the only strata with high reliability is BCR14 in New Brunswick, which shows a MD.  Some of the strata (eg bcr 4 in YK, bcr 10 in BC and bcr 8 in QC) show  extreme positive trends with very low precision.  (Note that strata with data starting after 1985, including BCR 4 are not included in the long-term trend).  Discussion with AS suggests the national long-term LI trend is driven by data from ON BCR8, QC BCR8 and QC BCR12, due to combination of YBFL population density in those strata, and strata size.  These strata have very poor (both BCR8 strata) or medium (QC BCR 12) coverage and low (both BCR8 strata) or medium (QC BCR 12) precision.  Despite this, the strata level trend graphs (available on the BBS website) show the LI reported for these three strata do seem to be reflected by the data (ie they are not the result of strange patterns in the data, ON BCR 8 and QC BCR 12 clearly show long term steady population increases, QC BCR8 less clear, but still no suggestion of a different pattern in the data).
